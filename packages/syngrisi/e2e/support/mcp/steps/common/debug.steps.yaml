  - pattern: 'I announce: {string}'
    description: |-
      Step definition: `When I announce: {string}`

      Announces a phrase using text-to-speech with a visible banner overlay.
      The banner is click-through (pointer-events: none) and disappears after speech completes.
      Useful for highlighting key moments during feature demonstrations without blocking indefinitely.
      This step is a no-op in CI environments.

      @param phrase - The text to be spoken aloud and displayed

      @example
      ```gherkin
      When I announce: "Now observe the drag and drop behavior"
      ```
    line: 426
  - pattern: 'I announce: {string} and PAUSE'
    description: |-
      Step definition: `When I announce: {string} and PAUSE`

      Announces a phrase using text-to-speech with a visible banner overlay, then pauses the Playwright runner.
      The banner is click-through (pointer-events: none) and disappears after pause is released.
      Useful for highlighting key moments during feature demonstrations with manual inspection.
      This step is a no-op in CI environments.

      @param phrase - The text to be spoken aloud and displayed before pausing

      @example
      ```gherkin
      When I announce: "Task creation completed" and PAUSE
      ```
    line: 455
  - pattern: I clear highlight
    description: |-
      Step definition: `When I clear highlight`

      Removes any active element highlight from the page.
      This step is a no-op in CI environments.

      @example
      ```gherkin
      When I clear highlight
      ```

  - pattern: I fail

  - pattern: I highlight element {string}
    description: |-
      Step definition: `When I highlight element {string}`

      Highlights a DOM element with a bright pulsing animation.
      The highlight persists until another element is highlighted or the highlight is cleared.
      Useful for drawing attention to specific UI elements during demos.
      This step is a no-op in CI environments.

      @param selector - CSS selector for the element to highlight

      @example
      ```gherkin
      When I highlight element "[data-testid='submit-button']"
      When I highlight element ".task-card"
      ```

      When I pause for 1000 ms
      When I pause for 500 ms
      ```
