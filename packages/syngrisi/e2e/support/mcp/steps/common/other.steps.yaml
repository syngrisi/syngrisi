    description: |-
      Step definition: `When I announce: {string}`

      Announces a phrase using text-to-speech with a visible banner overlay.
      The banner is click-through (pointer-events: none) and disappears after speech completes.
      Useful for highlighting key moments during feature demonstrations without blocking indefinitely.
      This step is a no-op in CI environments or when SKIP_DEMO_STEPS=true.

      @param phrase - The text to be spoken aloud and displayed

      @example
      ```gherkin
      When I announce: "Now observe the drag and drop behavior"
      ```

    description: |-
      Step definition: `When I announce: {string} and PAUSE`

      Announces a phrase using text-to-speech with a visible banner overlay, then pauses the Playwright runner.
      The banner is click-through (pointer-events: none) and disappears after pause is released.
      Useful for highlighting key moments during feature demonstrations with manual inspection.
      This step is a no-op in CI environments or when SKIP_DEMO_STEPS=true.

      @param phrase - The text to be spoken aloud and displayed before pausing

      @example
      ```gherkin
      When I announce: "Task creation completed" and PAUSE
      ```

  - pattern: I highlight element {string}
    description: |-
      Step definition: `When I highlight element {string}`
