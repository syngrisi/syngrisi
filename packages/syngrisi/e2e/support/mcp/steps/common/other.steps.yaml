      Step definition: `When I announce: {string}`

      The banner is click-through (pointer-events: none) and disappears after speech completes.
      Useful for highlighting key moments during feature demonstrations without blocking indefinitely.
      This step is a no-op in CI environments or when SKIP_DEMO_TESTS=true.

      @param phrase - The text to be spoken aloud and displayed

      @example
      ```gherkin

      This step is a no-op in CI environments or when SKIP_DEMO_TESTS=true.

      @param phrase - The text to be spoken aloud and displayed before pausing
