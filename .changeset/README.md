# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to add a changeset

When you make a change that should be noted in the changelog:

```bash
yarn changeset
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. Select the type of change (patch/minor/major)
2. Write a summary of the changes

This creates a markdown file in this folder describing the change.

## Versioning strategy

This monorepo uses **unified versioning** - all packages share the same version number.
This simplifies compatibility tracking: SDK 2.5.0 works with Service 2.5.0, 2.4.0, and 2.3.0 (N-2).

## More information

See [the changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
